# Nueva Exercise Tracker

### What this app is (supposed) to do
This app can be used to help track the number of hips, skips, and jumps you've performed while you're exercising!

On the screen, you'll see a count of each exercise since you've opened the app, as well as a couple buttons to track your exercises:
- Skip: record a single skip
- Hop: record a single hop
- Jump: record a single jump
- Jump 10 times: record 10 jumps
- Massive workout: record 10 skips, 10 hops, and 10 jumps

### What this app actually does
It sort of works, but there are examples of:
- Incorrect logic
- Bad variable names, function names, and/or (possibly) unused variables
- Inconsistent formatting, indenting, etc.
- Slippily defined stylesheets
- Code that was copied/pasted (ie. could be better organized using a loop)
- Code that could be better organized using a function with an argument(s) or component with a prop(s)

## Your task
Your task _not_ to add new features.  The goal _is_ to:
